				<h2>About ASCE</h2>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) was established in 1852 and is one of the earliest scientific and technological societies in the United States. ASCE serves over 150000 professional members in 177 countries and has cooperation agreements with 65 civil engineering societies worldwide. ASCE publishes over 50000 pages of professional journals, magazines, conference proceedings, monographs, technical reports, practical manuals, and standards annually. As a leader in the field of civil engineering, ASCE publications are comprehensive and authoritative, and its journals are important core journals in the field of civil engineering.
				</p>

				<h3>Covering Disciplines</h3>
				<p>
					Mechanics、Management、Structural、Construction、Environmental、Urban Planning、Geotechnical、Water Resources、Hydraulic、Coastal and Ocean、Aerospace、Materials、Architectural、Professional Issues、Energy、Transportation、Infrastructure、Computing in Civil Engineering
				</p>

				<h3>Develop History</h3>
				<p>
					On Nov. 5, 1852, a dozen eminent civil engineers gathered at the Croton Aqueduct in New York City, in the office of Chief Engineer Alfred W. Craven, to establish the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects. In 1868, a few years after architects had formed a professional society of their own, ASCE adopted its current name. For the first 144 years of its existence, ASCE maintained its headquarters in New York City, relocating six times to progressively larger facilities. In 1996, ASCE moved its global headquarters to Reston, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C.
				</p>

				<h3>Content Types</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Journals and Periodicals</strong><br>
					The technical and professional journals of the Society are the media through which independent researchers report their experiences and the results of their studies for the advancement of the civil engineering profession. Technical content is carefully peer-reviewed for possible publication in one of ASCE’s journals and periodicals.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>E-books</strong><br>
					ASCE e-books provide state-of-the-practice information and guidance on today’s engineering methods and technologies, from design and planning through application in the field. The collection includes ASCE Standards, Manuals and Reports on Engineering Practice, Committee Technical Reports, and ASCE Press titles.
					According to the latest Journal Citation Report (JCR), 34 journals have been indexed by SCI.22 journals with impact factors exceeding 2.The impact factors of 14 journals are higher than the median of all civil engineering journals and belong to the first or second zone of this category of journals.<br>The average growth rate of the impact factors in 2021 compared to 2020 is 15%.
				</p>

				<h3>Number of Collections and Upadate Frequency</h3>
				<p>
					The ASCE Library is the world’s largest full-text database of civil engineering research and practical publications. It offers unprecedented online access to more than 200,000 technical and professional papers—2.5 million pages of content. More than 5,000 papers are added annually.
				</p>

				<h3>Resources Already Ordered by Library</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>35 ASCE journals (1983 to present); ASCE proceedings (over 700 volumes, 1996 to present); Two well-known magazines (Civil Engineering Magazine and GEOSTATA Magazine) added in 2022.</li>
					<li>More than 400 e-books (1985-2020) covering topics such as engineering project management, construction, environmental engineering, urban planning, geological technology, and urban planning. This includes the Technical Council on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering Monographs (TCLEE) series, the Technical Council on Cold Regions Engineering Monographs (TCCRE) series, the Council on Disaster Risk Management (CDRM) series, as well as a series of technical reports, practice manuals, and special publications.</li>

				<h2>Experiences and Recommendations Based on User Feedback</h2>
				<p>
					Based on my own user experience, I believe there are some areas that can be improved.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Fuzzy search: Due to differences in language and personal foreign language proficiency, I may not be clear about how to accurately express a professional vocabulary in English, and there may be discrepancies between the searched literature and the expected results. If fuzzy search or multilingual search functions are supported, this problem may be avoided.
					<img src="ASCE-4.1.jpg" style="width: 900px;">
					</li>
					<li>
						Collection function: Due to the use of institutional login, I need to log in to my personal account to collect literature, but I am unable to view the full text and download literature under my personal account. In this case, it is necessary to download the literature to achieve the purpose of saving, but sometimes my collection of literature only serves as a secondary screening function.
					<img src="ASCE-4.2.jpg" style="width: 400px; margin-left: 250px;">
					</li>
					<li>
						Reference: When I want to cite this article, I cannot directly obtain the citation format. I must first download and import the citation file into another software. This brings convenience for writing papers with batch citations, but if I only want to annotate the citation source, such as using an image of this article in the PPT, the citation in this case is very inconvenient.
